# Important Notes
- THIS PLUGIN USES THE nLogin API! You MUST have nLogin installed on your SPIGOT server for this to work!
- This plugin will not work without an access code and is for now invite only. I'll work on making this public soon, but for now dm @pyroedged on discord for access on release.
- Velocity is coming soon!

# Our Mission with ModernAuth
ModernAuth's goal is to simplify and revolutionize authentication on offline-mode (cracked) Minecraft servers. By automating password resets and reducing the need for human intervention, we strive to create a more secure, user-friendly environment for both players and server administrators.
Our system drastically streamlines account recovery and password management, eliminating the frustrations associated with lost credentials. In doing so, we allow server owners to focus on delivering the best possible gameplay experience rather than spending time on manual authentication tasks. ModernAuth is designed to protect against unauthorized access, simplify user logins, and ensure that communities can thrive without compromising on convenience or security. We believe that by removing barriers to seamless authentication, we can make Minecraft servers more accessible, enjoyable, and trustworthy for all.
